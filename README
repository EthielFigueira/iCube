Briefly about the project:

With iCubes platform you can add different properties and features to real objects 
and interact with them in virtual space. You can "write" characters, numbers, words 
or even chemical elements on a simple colored cube, and with help of a simple 
web-camera, platform tracks its location. Based on a set of rules and input 
information the cube is being transformed into an object in virtual space.

The platform id design in a way that any user can add their own plug-in without
modifying the source code of the platform
